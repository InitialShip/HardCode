				Perlin noise is a type of gradient noise developed by Ken Perlin in 1983 as 
				a result of his frustration with the "machine-like" look of computer-generated 
				imagery (CGI) at the time.
			</p>
			<p class="two">
				Perlin noise resulted from the work of Ken Perlin, who developed it at 
				Mathematical Applications Group, Inc. (MAGI) for Disney's computer animated 
				sci-fi motion picture Tron (1982). In 1997, he won an Academy Award for 
				Technical Achievement from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
				Sciences for this contribution to CGI.

				Perlin noise is most commonly implemented as a two-, three- or four-dimensional 
				function, but can be defined for any number of dimensions. An implementation 
				typically involves three steps: grid definition with random gradient vectors, 
				computation of the dot product between the distance-gradient vectors and 
				interpolation between these values.
