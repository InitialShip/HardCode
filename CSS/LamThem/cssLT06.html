  <h1>Nuclear power</h1>
  <h2>Environmental impact</h2>
  <h3>carbon emissions</h3>
  <p>Nuclear power is one of the leading low carbon power generation methods of producing electricity, and in terms of total life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy generated, has emission values comparable to or lower than renewable energy. A 2014 analysis of the carbon footprint literature by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that the embodied total life-cycle emission intensity of fission electricity has a median value of 12 g CO
  2eq/kWh, which is the lowest out of all commercial baseload energy sources. This is contrasted with coal and natural gas at 820 and 490 g CO
  2 eq/kWh. From the beginning of its commercialization in the 1970s, nuclear power has prevented the emission of about 64 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent that would have otherwise resulted from the burning of fossil fuels in thermal power stations.</p>
