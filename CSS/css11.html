					In mathematics, non-Euclidean geometry consists of two geometries based on 
					axioms closely related to those specifying Euclidean geometry. As Euclidean 
					geometry lies at the intersection of metric geometry and affine geometry, 
					non-Euclidean geometry arises when either the metric requirement is relaxed, 
					or the parallel postulate is replaced with an alternative one. In the latter 
					case one obtains hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry, the traditional 
					non-Euclidean geometries. When the metric requirement is relaxed, then there 
					are affine planes associated with the planar algebras which give rise to 
					kinematic geometries that have also been called non-Euclidean geometry.

					The beginning of the 19th century would finally witness decisive steps in the 
					creation of non-Euclidean geometry. Circa 1813, Carl Friedrich Gauss and independently 
					around 1818, the German professor of law Ferdinand Karl Schweikart[9] had the 
					germinal ideas of non-Euclidean geometry worked out, but neither published any results. 
					Schweikart's nephew Franz Taurinus did publish important results of hyperbolic 
					trigonometry in two papers in 1825 and 1826, yet while admitting the internal 
					consistency of hyperbolic geometry, he still believed in the special role of Euclidean geometry.

					The simplest model for elliptic geometry is a sphere, where lines are 
					"great circles" (such as the equator or the meridians on a globe), and points 
					opposite each other (called antipodal points) are identified (considered to be the same). 
					This is also one of the standard models of the real projective plane. The difference 
					is that as a model of elliptic geometry a metric is introduced permitting the measurement 
					of lengths and angles, while as a model of the projective plane there is no such metric.

				<div class="article">
					In three dimensions, there are eight models of geometries.[21] There are Euclidean, 
					elliptic, and hyperbolic geometries, as in the two-dimensional case; mixed geometries 
					that are partially Euclidean and partially hyperbolic or spherical; twisted versions of 
					the mixed geometries; and one unusual geometry that is completely anisotropic 
					(i.e. every direction behaves differently).
